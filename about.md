title: About CRUx
---

CRUx is the Programming and Computing club for BITS Hyderabad. From a small club of a few passionate coders
since it's inception in 2010, we have grown a whole lot. During this time, we have aimed to kindle a passion
for
technology and better the programming culture of our college. We also strive to make things on campus easier
and
more convenient via the means of code.
