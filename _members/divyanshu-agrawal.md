I'm currently learning various web-technologies, and learning languages and frameworks like JavaScript, Node.JS, React, Express etc. I love to make practical applications based on what I have learnt all the time, although sadly I always keep switching projects :3. Apart from programming, I like to read books, and play PC games.

## Skills

I am skilled in :

- JavaScript and it's derived frameworks and libraries like React, JQuery etc.
- Node.JS and various modules like Express, Pug.
- MySQL, MongoDB.
- C++, C, PHP, Java.
